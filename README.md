### How to run the different C files?
For running all the different `C` files, you will first need to install the `gcc` compiler. For doing this:

- In Windows
    - Highly recommendable to install [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once downloaded, you will have to start the wsl by running `wsl` in your PowerShell.
        - Now that you are in the Windows Subsystem for Linux, you will be able to run the linux commands. For downloading the necessary dependencies for developing in C in any Debian based distro, run the following:
            ```bash
            sudo apt update;
            sudo apt install libc-dev g++ build-essential;
            ```
        - Now you can start compiling and running the files. For a file called `T1S2P2TresGeneracions.c`, the command for compiling and running the file would be the following:
          ```bash
          gcc path/to/T1S2P2TresGeneracions.c -o output/path/T1S2P2TresGeneracions && output/path/T1S2P2TresGeneracions
          ```  


- In Linux
    - If not installed, install the necessary dependencies for developing in `C`. For Debian based distros:
        ```bash
        sudo apt update;
        sudo apt install libc-dev g++ build-essential;
        ```
    - Run the files. Example for a file called `T1S2P2TresGeneracions.c`:
        ```bash
          gcc path/to/T1S2P2TresGeneracions.c -o output/path/T1S2P2TresGeneracions && output/path/T1S2P2TresGeneracions
        ```
